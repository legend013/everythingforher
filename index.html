            <h3>Note.2 25.02.25</h3>
            <p>A warm good morning for my lovable girl. Its's been a long time without a beautiful note for my baby girl. On the context of last time, without any difficulties or any setbacks, I feel I am the only one who was loved, loving, and will be loved forever. It's not just because we're here over a period. Spontaneously I'm feeling the love from day 1. Beyond every circumstances even though we can't meet, can't see each other for longer period. I was always feel I was the under the radiation of your love. Since day 1 to here, all those days. The most luckiest person on this planet earth. I must done something great in past so because of that I got a most precious and priceless gift as a you in life. Forever thank you and thankful of your efforts on me. I love you Divya.    </p>
            <h3>Note.3 09.03.25</h3>
            <p>Heyy to the most beautiful and amazing girl. You're simply the most loveable creation by the god. The amount of love you deserve is something which is unmeasurable and can't even provide the deserved perseverance to you. It always feels like that I'm the only who is bounded by the love. Thankyou for making it the most wholesome moment of my life. I love you Divya </p>
            <h3>Note.4 13.03.25</h3>
            <p>I understand I feel I love. I respect your decision. Will be supporting you till the death. I know how you are feeling about it. Going through all those ups and downs, taking all the words, under the boundaries. I know that you're my brave girl. You need to be brave. I have faith that my divya can deal in this situation. Never seen such the strongest beautiful girl. So proud of you baby. You're my everything, I'm giving you everything you want. We both leave the mark that the break can't make a difference between us. I really appreciate what we are doing for us. It's just one of the tough decisions of life. I'm all good and okkk how long the break goes. It won't bother me and make me feel insecure about it. I know we are doing it for us, for our family, for our studies. You're the best thing that happened to me so it's obvious I'm privileged about it. Every step matters for us. Doing well knowing that I will always love you. You don't need to worry about it my baby. I love you divya.</p>
