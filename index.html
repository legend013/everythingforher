            <h3>Note.2 02.25.25</h3>
            <p>A warm good morning for my lovable girl. Its's been a long time without a beautiful note for my baby girl. On the context of last time, without any difficulties or any setbacks, I feel I am the only one who was loved, loving, and will be loved forever. It's not just because we're here over a period. Spontaneously I'm feeling the love from day 1. Beyond every circumstances even though we can't meet, can't see each other for longer period. I was always feel I was the under the radiation of your love. Since day 1 to here, all those days. The most luckiest person on this planet earth. I must done something great in past so because of that I got a most precious and priceless gift as a you in life. Forever thank you and thankful of your efforts on me. I love you Divya.    </p>
